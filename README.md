# node-red-iot-starter-kit

Work in Progess. Expected completion date mid June 2017

A virtual kit of parts and laser cutting files to create a Raspberry Pi based Internet of Things "swiss army knife".
The idea is to connect as many things as possible to allow data collection and interaction via the IoT specifically using node-red on Bluemix and other Bluemix IoT oferrings.
With your finished starter kit you'll be able to detect a person, move a servo arm, speak via text to speech, listen via a microphone, blink/change the colour of an LED, monitor the Raspberry Pi device and more.

Coming soon!
